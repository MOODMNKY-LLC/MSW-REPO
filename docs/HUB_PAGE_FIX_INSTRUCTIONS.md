# HUB Page Fix Instructions

## Issue
The duplicate cleanup script removed the wrong Annotated Bibliographies database link, keeping an empty one instead of the one with your attachment theory bibliographies.

## Good News ✅
Your bibliographies are **still safe** in the database! They were not deleted.

## Database Information
- **Database ID**: `2becd2a6-5422-8122-b027-ebf51261d743`
- **Database URL**: https://www.notion.so/2becd2a654228122b027ebf51261d743
- **Data Source ID**: `2becd2a6-5422-81eb-a182-000b583f5721`

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Manual Fix (Recommended)
1. Open your HUB page: https://www.notion.so/2becd2a6542280438939e4bb0316a593
2. Scroll to the section with database links (after "💡 Tip" section)
3. Find any empty "Annotated Bibliographies" database blocks and delete them
4. Click the "+" button or type `/database` where you want to add the link
5. Select "Link to database"
6. Search for "Annotated Bibliographies" or paste this URL:
   - https://www.notion.so/2becd2a654228122b027ebf51261d743
7. The database should appear with your 2 bibliographies:
   - Attachment Theory in Clinical Social Work Practice
   - Attachment Theory in Child and Family Social Work

### Option 2: Use Cursor Chat
Ask Cursor:
> "Add the Annotated Bibliographies database link to the HUB page after Session Notes. The database ID is 2becd2a6-5422-8122-b027-ebf51261d743"

## Verify Your Bibliographies
Your bibliographies are accessible at:
- [Bibliography 1: Clinical Social Work](https://www.notion.so/Attachment-Theory-in-Clinical-Social-Work-Practice-2becd2a654228153beedecb6a87892fd)
- [Bibliography 2: Child and Family Social Work](https://www.notion.so/Attachment-Theory-in-Child-and-Family-Social-Work-2becd2a65422819eb5eed0eb8d5cb95e)

## Note
The Notion API doesn't support creating `child_database` blocks programmatically, so manual addition is required. The bibliographies themselves are safe and intact in the database.
