### Alternative Methods

While Official Notion MCP is the primary method, alternative approaches are available:

1. **Direct API Scripts** - See [Notion Integration Guide](./NOTION_INTEGRATION.md)
   - Useful for automation and batch operations
   - Requires API key management
   - Good for scheduled tasks

2. **Open-Source MCP Server** - See [Notion MCP OAuth Setup](./NOTION_MCP_OAUTH_SETUP.md)
   - API key-based alternative
   - More control over server
   - Requires API key management

### Best Practices

1. **Use Cursor Chat** for interactive Notion operations
2. **Use Direct API Scripts** for automation and batch operations
3. **Keep both methods** - MCP for interactive use, scripts for automation

### Troubleshooting

If Notion MCP stops working:

1. **Check Connection**: Verify connection in Notion app (Settings → Connections → Notion MCP)
2. **Restart Cursor**: Close and reopen Cursor IDE
3. **Re-authorize**: Reconnect through Notion app if needed
4. **Test Connection**: Try a simple search query in Cursor chat
