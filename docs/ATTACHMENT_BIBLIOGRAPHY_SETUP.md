## Creating Entries in Notion

Since the Notion MCP is connected and working, you can use Cursor chat to create the entries. Here are the commands you can use:

### Option 1: Use Cursor Chat (Recommended)

Simply ask Cursor:
```
"Create two annotated bibliography entries in Notion:
1. Attachment Theory in Clinical Social Work Practice (SOCW-6510)
2. Attachment Theory in Child and Family Social Work (SOCW-6510)

Then create 10 article entries in the Articles database with the information from storage/bibliographies/attachment-theory-annotated-bibliographies.md"
```

### Option 2: Manual Creation

1. Go to Notion → HUB → Annotated Bibliographies database
2. Create two new entries:
   - Topic: "Attachment Theory in Clinical Social Work Practice"

   - Status: Writing
   - Due Date: 2025-12-15

3. Go to Articles database and create 10 entries using the information from the markdown file
